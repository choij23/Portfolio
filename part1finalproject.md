# Part 1 Final Project

## Outline

Based on my personal experience working in home health agencies, I am interested in whether the type of location - rural, suburban, urban - plays a role in patient satisfaction and rating of the home health agencies. I predict that since urban home health agencies have more resources and funding generally because of their location, patients are highly satisfied with the care they received. For suburban and rural home health agencies, patient satisfaction would be lower, respectively due to the lack of resources. There are many factors that would explain the differences in the satisfaction rating within home health care agencies. Overall, this would stress the need for focusing getting government support to eradicate those differences to provide quality health care to patients. 

## Project Structure

* Introduction
	* How does patient care satisfaction in home health care agencies differ according to the type of location areas (urban, suburban, and rural) and why?
* Body
	* Definitions of what urban, suburban and rural mean
		* Give some examples of locations from the dataset that fit into these definitions (visual map of those locations in the US)
	* Rating system on patient care satisfaction that the patient survey uses in the dataset 
	* What I found in my data analysis - multiple data visualizations (from Flourish or Tableau)
	* Factors on why there are differences (visual representation of those factors)
		* Funding
		* Resources
		* Location type
		* Other
	* What this all means summary
* Conclusion
	* Therefore, these data visualizations call for a need to focus more on helping home health care agencies that have low patient care satisfaction ratings with the help of the federal government.

## The Data

I discovered the data on home health care agencies through the website data.gov. With the help of google, I was able to search through multiple accessible sources of data and data.gov was one of them. The website data.gov is a public accessible source of many types of government data. The site is managed and hosted by the United States General Services Administration, specifically the Technology Transformation Service department. This source is actually developed publicly on Github which is the same site I am developing my final project portfolio on. 

Since the site is managed by the government, the data provided must be made available to the public while at the same time, ensuring privacy and security. It is required that agencies publish a list of their data assets that are public. What the home health care data encompass is the results of a patient survey given to home health care agencies throughout the whole nation. This dataset was published by the Department of Health and Human Services on November 10, 2020, so this data is recent. 

Some of the questions on the patient survey were about how well the health care team gave care; how well was the communication with that team; how the patient rate the overall care from the agency; and so much more. The dataset also provided the locations of each home health care agency in the nation. I plan to use both the location and some of the rating questions to create data visualizations on whether my guess was correct or not.

## Method and Medium

I plan to complete my final project using Shorthand. Based on Riley's lecture on using Shorthand, I found it to be very user-friendly and useful for presenting aesthetically pleasing data visualizations. Also, Professor Goranson has presented to us previous students' final projects on Shorthand. With those examples, I feel that I will most likely use Shorthand for my final project presentation.

I also plan to do some research on funding and resources information for home health care agencies throughout the United States. I intend to create data visualizations explaining why agencies in certain areas receive more or less funding. Based on that, I may create something to depict the factors explaining these differences. I believe Shorthand will be able to allow me to present all the data visualizations I have to tell my story.
