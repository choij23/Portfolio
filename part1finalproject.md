# Part 1 Final Project

Outline

It is a widely known fact that disparities in health care access exist in America, especially in minority communities or populations of color. This disparity also is apparent in the disabled community. I am interested in how the accessibility to health care services is affected by the intersection of minority population and deaf population when compared to the non-disabled and non-POC population. Also, I want to discover what main factors are causing that very issue of accessible health care.
