# Part 3 Final Project

## Changes Since Part 2

Some of the major changes that I have made since Part 2 was narrowing the scope of my topic to the state of Pennsylvania. My dataset from data.gov contained patient survey data from a multitude of home health care agencies across the whole nation, however, there was no corresponding location type data with this dataset. In my research, I found a website called Rural Information Hub that had an incredibly useful tool which allowed me to confirm whether the city is rural or not. However, this tool was very limited in that it can only search one location at a time. This was a dilemma because the nationwide dataset consisted of about 11,000+ data. Since I lack programming skills to create a program that would search across multiple data and assign them the location type, I had to focus the dataset to one state.

I chose Pennsylvania because it is where I grew up. Additionally, I have had patient care experience working for home health care agencies in rural and urban areas of Pennsylvania, so this topic was interesting and informative for me. One city in PA that I was not surprised to find it being rural was Meadville because it was where I attended for my undergraduate education. It was where I worked part-time for a home health care agency in Meadville. When I saw the HHCAHPS star rating for the rural home health agency in Meadville, the 4 star rating was what I expected from the rural home health agency. 

I also took out the definition of suburban because there was no clear, set definition of what it entails based on the Census Bureau's definitions. The US Census Bureau only defined areas in terms of urban and rural areas. Another change I made that was previously mentioned in the second part of the final project was not including the amount of funding for each location type because I was not able to find data on them. However, there were many supporting evidence I found that explained why rural home health care agencies have lower patient satisfaction than urban agencies. As I listed in the Shorthand link, lack of broadband width, complex regulation and reimbursement process, homebound eligibility issues, geographic isolation, transportation, and financial resources are all contributing factors in why rural home health care agencies give lesser quality care, hence, low patient satisfaction.

Despite restricting my topic to one state, my audience still remains the same where I am informing my audience of the contrast of patient care satisfaction provided by home health care agencies in different location types. As my call to action, I implored my audience to search for their respective state's health department to advocate for more funding and resources towards these rural home health care agencies. 

Additionally, what I discovered throughout the process of working on part 3 was that there were not much survey data results for rural home health care agencies when compared to that for urban rural home health care agencies. In fact, most of the survey results for the rural home health care agencies were not available due to not having enough resources to do the survey in the first place. Therefore, my call to action is exactly why we need to advocate getting these rural home health care agencies more resources and funding in the first place: to be able to give quality patient care.
