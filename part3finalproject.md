## Part 3 Final Project

# Changes Since Part 2

Some of the major changes that I have made since Part 2 was narrowing the scope of my topic to the state of Pennsylvania. My dataset from data.gov contained patient survey data from a multitude of home health care agencies across the whole nation, however, there was no corresponding location type data with this dataset. In my research, I found a website called Rural Information Hub that had an incredibly useful tool which allowed me to confirm whether the city is rural or not. However, this tool was very limited in that it can only search one location at a time. This was a dilemma because the nationwide dataset consisted of about 11,000+ data. Since I lack programming skills to create a program that would search across multiple data and assign them the location type, I had to focus the dataset to one state. I chose Pennsylvania because it is where I grew up. Additionally, I have had patient care experience working for home health care agencies in rural areas, so this topic was interesting for me. One city in PA that I was not surprised to find it being rural was Meadville because it was where I attended for my undergraduate education. I have also worked for a home health care agency in Meadville.
