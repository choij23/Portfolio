# My Data Visualization of General Government Debt

This is my take on visualizing the data on the countries' total government debt in % of GDP, ranging from 1995 to 2019.

Markdown to write a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  Talk about why you chose the third data visualization.

All three data visualizations are telling the same story: the total government debt of multiple countries in percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP). Yet, there are several distinctions between them. The first data visualization displays a single bar chart of all the countries' general government debt in one year, specifically 2019. The second data visualization displays a grid of line charts where each country has its own line chart of their government debt, ranging from 1995 to 2019. So, this chart was able to show the change of the total government debt over a long period of time. For the last data visualization, I chose a grid of bar charts where it conveys the same meaning as the second data visualization, but through bar graphs rather than line graphs. The reason why I chose this particular chart type was because the bars give a better visualization on comparing the amount of percentage of GDP in each year.
