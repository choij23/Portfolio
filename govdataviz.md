# My Data Visualization of General Government Debt

This is my take on visualizing the data on the countries' total government debt in % of GDP, ranging from 1995 to 2019.

All three data visualizations are telling the same story: the total government debt of multiple countries in percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP). Yet, there are several distinctions between them. The first data visualization displays a single bar chart of all the countries' general government debt in one year, specifically 2019. Essentially, with this chart, we can easily see the comparison of the countries' government debt in a year. The second data visualization displays a grid of line charts where each country has its own line chart of their government debt, ranging from 1995 to 2019. So, this chart was able to show the change of the total government debt over a long period of time. For the last data visualization, I chose a grid of bar charts where it conveys the same meaning as the second data visualization, but through bar graphs rather than line graphs. The reason why I chose this particular chart type was because the bars give a better visualization on comparing the amount of percentage of GDP in each year. Not only that, but I also chose a color scheme of light to dark colors to indicate that the lighter colors represent past years and the darker colors represent recent years. This color scheme allows the audience to tell that the data is displayed sequentially. Additionally, with both the second and third data visualization, each country's chart is depicted with the same x and y axes, allowing for comparisons to be made objectively.
