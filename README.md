# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data course by Professor Christopher Goranson. 

# About Me
My name is Jeannie Choi (she/her/hers) and I am a first-year MSHCPM student at Heinz College Carnegie Mellon University! I studied Biology for my Bachelor of Science degree at Allegheny College, and after graduation, I worked as a research technician at University of Pittsburgh for three years. 

From this course, I hope to gain knowledge and insight on how to utilize data visualization to tell a story.
