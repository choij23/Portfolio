(The second graphic in tablular form created by Jiachuan Wu, Nigel Chiwaya and Joe Murphy)

The reason why I chose this graphic for my data visualization assignment was to improve the visual appearance to make an impact especially on readers who rely on visuals to learn new information. I understood why the creator of this graphic chose a table as the format to display their data because they had so much data. But, I wanted to choose a particular set of data, specifically the percent changes in 1 week for all the states and territories for my data visualization. 

The original graphic is very useful and reliable, and I thought it was a complete data visualization overall. I also really enjoyed the aspect of being able to choose which set of data you wanted the states and territories to be sorted. But, the numbers aspect of the table is intimidating. Hence, when considering a redesign, I wanted to create a visually appealing data visualization. So, I was mainly focused on improving the aesthetics of the graphics to tell the story of the changes in COVID-19 cases in the United States. 

These are the wireframes that I have done for this assignment, and that I have asked 3 people for their feedback on.

Due to feedback, I chose the 1-week change in COVID-19 cases in the states and territories because it clearly depicts the increases and decreases in cases for each state/territories. I knew that I wanted to use a column graph to depict NBC's COVID-19 data, so originally, I started making my data visualization with Flourish. I was able to come up with an almost finished product, but there were some difficulties in reading the x-axis labels of the graphic. For one, it was a vertical column graph, so the labels for the states/territories were vertically arranged. In one of my sketches, I drew a graphic of horizontal columns to make it easier for the readers to read the states and territories. At this point, I realize that there are limitations with the platform in getting my final data visualization because Flourish did not have an option to create horizontal columns. It is possible that there was a method, but I was not aware of it.

So, I turned to Tableau to create a horizontal column graphic. With this type of data visualization, I was able to display the states and territories in horizontal view rather than vertical view. I also higlighted the column for Pennsylvania red to see how our state fares in the cases when comparing to other states. I believe this data visualization resembles most closely to my vision of the final data visualization.
