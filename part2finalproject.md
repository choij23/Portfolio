# Part 2 Final Project

## Feedback on Part 1 Final Project
Some of the critique I have received on the first part of my final project were to:
* consider the cost/funding data on these home health care agencies as part of my storytelling
* have a specific call to action because my previous call to action was very generalized
* possibly focus on a specific state such as Pennsylvania because I was informed that there are plenty of data on PA's home health care agencies provided by the Budget for Human Health Services

## Wireframes/Sketches

## User Research & Interview
The target audience I hope to reach with my story is the people of the United States who are well-invested in their grandparents' health care. I want to inform them that they have the power to make an impact in their loved ones' care. There are currently many programs centered on providing resources to areas that are lacking resources and funding needed to provide quality care to the elderly population. One example is the Center for Rural Pennsylvania, a lesgislative agency that focuses on rural policy within rural Pennsylvania. They have also done work for health care access to home health care agencies within the rural areas of the state. Hence, my specific call to action to my audience would be to push them to contact their state department of health to provide more resources and funding as the first step to enacting change within the home health care industry. 

My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview included a wide demographic of individuals who are unfamiliar with the topic of home health care agencies and how patient care satisfaction differs based on population location type. What this entailed was interviewing people of my age as well as those older than me. 

Listed below is my interview script that I have used to gained critical findings about what people thought of my wireframes. 

* Introduction

I will introduce myself and why I am here today with them. I will briefly explain what my assignment is for which is the course, "Telling Stories with Data." This will take up less than 10 minutes of their time, and I will stress to them that there is no wrong or right answers to the questions that I will ask them. 

* Interview Script

I will ask them what their job is and what their job responsibilities entail to gain a better idea of their background. I will also provide a table chart where they can write what they like about the website; what they don't like about the website; how they would like to see website be improved

| What You Like  | What You Don't Like | What could be improved? |
| -------------  | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ______________ | ____________________| ________________________|

1. First off, could you tell me what is your first impression on the website and the data visualizations?
2. What do you think the story is about? Essentially, what is the purpose of the website?
3. Do you have any questions about the story, data visualizations, or even the website itself?

* Wrap-Up

I will thank them for their time and participation. I will also end with asking them if they have any questions for me regarding the interview and what they went through.

* Findings

Based on the interview's answers in the table, it seemed what they liked about the storyboard and data visualizations is the consistent color scheme and the clean look of the storyboard. It was obvious that the storyboard flowed well for the interviewees because they mention that they could understand the story that I intended for them. One was especially appreciative of my call to action - "The call to action part was excellent, especially with the search bar!" As for what they did not like about the storyboard was the lack of content and titles in my slides. There was one data visualization on patient care satisfaction rating where one mentioned about having "some concerns about the 100% rating for satisfaction." The pie chart was also confusing to one interviewee because the content was vague for them. Because I have received many feedback, I also received tips on what could be improved in the storyboard. There were tips such as the wording in my title slide and combining the last two slides. 

For the answers to the three questions I had for them, it seems that their first impressions of the storyboard and data visualizations was that it was cleanly well-presented and that the visualizations helped in telling the story. Based on the content of their responses, I was able to tell that they were correct in knowing the purpose of my story and what it was about. Additionally, one interviewee wanted more information on "why rural home health centers are important in the first place (i.e. population of elderly is higher in rural areas vs urban areas." This remark was incredibly helpful in thinking the kind of information my audience would want to know more about because after all, the audience cannot gauge the story without enough background information. 

* Future Changes

The changes I plan on implementing to my visualizations next week will address the more of the issues found from my user research as well as the critique I received in today's lecture (Wednesday, March 10, 2021). Some of the critique I received during class was that the number of people for the rural, suburban and urban areas was unclear. Someone wondered whether the number of people was according to how many feet there were - basically the population density. This is something that I will have to look into as well as making sure that my definitions are clear and free of confusion. I will also include citations in the final project to ensure that sources are accordingly accredited. I also plan to use Tableau and possibly Flourish to create detailed data visualizations. I will also start creating a Shorthand page for the final presentation and project. Overall, I will be starting on completing the third part of the final project.
