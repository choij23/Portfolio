# Part 2 Final Project

## Feedback on Part 1 Final Project
Some of the critique I have received on the first part of my final project were to:
* consider the cost/funding data on these home health care agencies as part of my storytelling
* have a specific call to action because my previous call to action was very generalized
* possibly focus on a specific state such as Pennsylvania because I was informed that there are plenty of data on PA's home health care agencies provided by the Budget for Human Health Services

## Wireframes/Sketches
updated wireframes

## User Research Plan
The target audience I hope to reach with my story is the programs centered on providing resources to areas that are lacking resources and funding needed to provide quality care to the elderly population. Hence, my specific call to action to my audience would be to push them to contact their state department of health to enact change within the home health care industry by providing more resources and funding. 

My approach to identifying representative individuals to interview includes a wide demographic of individuals who are unfamiliar with the topic of home health care agencies and how patient care satisfaction differs based on population location type. 

Listed below is my interview script that I have used to gained findings about what people thought of my wireframes. 
* Introduction:
I will introduce myself and why I am here today with them. I will briefly explain what my assignment is for which is the course, "Telling Stories with Data." This will take up less than 10 minutes of their time, and I will stress to them that there is no wrong or right answers to the questions that I will ask them. 

* Interview Script:
I will ask them what their job is and what their job responsibilities entail to gain a better idea of their background. I will also provide a table chart where they can write what they like about the website; what they don't like about the website; how they would like to see website be improved

What You Liked	What You Don't Liked	What could be improved?
		

	1. First off, could you tell me what is your first impression on the website and the data visualizations?
	2. What do you think the story is about? Essentially, what is the purpose of the website?
	3. Do you have any questions about the story, data visualizations or even the website itself? 

* Wrap-Up
I will thank them for their time and participation. I will also end with asking them if they have any questions for me regarding the interview and what they went through.

a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.
