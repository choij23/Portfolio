# Part 2 Final Project

## Feedback on Part 1 Final Project
Some of the critique I have received on the first part of my final project were to:
* consider the cost/funding data on these home health care agencies as part of my storytelling
* have a specific call to action because my previous call to action was very generalized
* possibly focus on a specific state such as Pennsylvania because I was informed that there are plenty of data on PA's home health care agencies provided by the Budget for Human Health Services
